# Ricker ![alt text](https://travis-ci.org/whatsrupp/ricker.svg?branch=master 'ricker build status')

## It's like Twitter, except there's a slightly irritating Rick Astley theme. 
The idea is that users send 'rickrolls' to one another to fuel a dying internet fad, rather than tweeting at each other.

That's actually pretty much the whole concept. Don't worry I'm just as underwhelmed as you probably are!

Jokes aside, I assembled this app on the hottest day of the year (so far) on a picnic bench outside. I had a great time, was a great opportunity to get to grips with encryption and database management!

## Terminology 
Here's a comprehensive breakdown of the key jargon in this project

Original | Bootleg
--- | --- 
Twitter| Ricker 
Tweet | Roll 

It took me a while to get used to, but just stick with it.

## Checking out the app
This used to be hosted live on Heroku but they mercilessly 'snooze' free websites that aren't really getting used to free up server space. So, for now, you'll have to check it out offline, but it was a particularly good moment when my friends were unleashed on the live chat feed from across the country and we had a chat on it!
If it is live, it will be [here](https://chitter-nick.herokuapp.com/) but I highly doubt it.

## Offline Set Up

#### 1) Set up your developer environment
First off, it's assumed that your chassis has been rigged out with all the basic developer tools. If it isn't, [this](http://www.preparetocode.io/) is probably a good place to start
Also, you'll want to have ruby installed. [This](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) might help out.

#### 2) Clone this repository
Crack open your terminal, direct to where you want the repository to download and clone away.
```
cd where/you/want/to/clone/ricker
git clone https://github.com/whatsrupp/ricker
```

#### 3) Get and use Bundler
You'll need to get the underlying software used to run this app onto your machine. The best way is via bundler run the following:
```
gem install bundler
bundle install
```
All the relevant packages should be snugly operating on your machine now and ready to go.
#### 4) Boot the server
Launch the server using the rackup gem
```
rackup
```
you should then see a server log that looks something like the below:
```
[2017-04-29 23:50:14] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1
[2017-04-29 23:50:14] INFO  ruby 2.4.0 (2016-12-24) [x86_64-darwin16]
[2017-04-29 23:50:14] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=18767 port=9292
```
the listed port (in this case 9292) is the port you need to access in your browser. 
Open up the browser and enter the following into your URL.
```
localhost:9292
```
#### 5) Enjoy!
Sign up and launch some highly questionable tweets onto your very own private ricker server!

## Packages Used
Shout out to the gems holding together my fragile code!

- bcrypt - keeping those passwords deliciously salted
- capybara - for running tests in a headless browser 
- sinatra - good singer, better web-app manager
- data-mapper - handles talking to the servers so you don't have to
- database cleaner - clears out swathes of rubbish in your server generated by your tests
- rack - 'rack up' those servers 
- pry - probably shouldn't still be in the dependancies but it saved a lot of debugging time
- rspec - keeping it all TDD since day 1

That's about all really!

If you're actually reading this then good going and thank you!
